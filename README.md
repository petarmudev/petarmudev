### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java.
 - It all started as an adventure to see if I still have what it takes. (since my C++ and C# background experience)
- Now?
- Now I truly 😍 it.

- My target is to get ready for the  unknown road ahead.
- There is no going back now...this is a one way road for me. :)
